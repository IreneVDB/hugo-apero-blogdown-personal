### What is a biological clock?

A biological clock is an internal timing mechanism that regulates the rhythmic occurrence of various processes within plants, animals and humans. The sleep-wake cycle, the female menstrual cycle, bird migration or the mating behavior of animals are all examples of daily, monthly, annual or seasonal rhythms. A *circadian rhythm*, from the Latin *circa* and *dies* (meaning *about* and *day*), is a rhythm of about 24 hours. A crucial feature of a biological clock and the circadian rhythm is that the rhythm continues even if there is no (external) notion of time. 

### The first discoveries

The difference between this *internal* and *external* regulation was first described by Jean Jacques d’Ortous de Mairan. In the 18th century, the French mathematician and astronomer was intrigued by the opening and folding of the leaves of his mimosa plants with the rising and setting of the sun. When he placed the plants in a dark closet, he discovered that the plants, even in the absence of sun light, kept opening and folding with the same daily rhythm.

A similar external regulation was demonstrated in animals that were kept in either a lit or darkened room. While their activity patterns showed a very constant rhythm, the time at which the animals were active moved to an earlier or later time every day (**Figure 1**). This circadian rhythm has also been demonstrated in man [1]. In 1962, the French geologist Michel Siffre stayed in an underground cave without any sunlight, trying to record the time of day. Even though Siffre thought he had spend 37 nights underground instead of the 62 nights that had actually passed, the times at which he had dinner, went to bed and woke up showed that his biological clock kept working with a regular rhythm of about 24 hours.

When placed in a room without light, their activity pattern remains rhythmic over a period that is longer 24 hours.  When, on the other hand, placed in a constantly lit environment, they will be active a little earlier every day. For nocturnal animals the pattern is reversed: their sleep-wake rhythm will be shorter when placed in a dark environment. Figure adapted from Circadian Rhythms in Man [1].

### Chronobiology: the study of circadian rhythms

Although the existence of a biological clock was known for a while, the exact working has only been revealed over the past decades. In 2017, the Nobel prize for physiology or medicine was awarded to three chronobiologists for their work on circadian rhythms. The researchers had discovered the so-called *clock genes* (with names as *period*, *timeless*, and *doubletime*) that are involved in the regulation of the biological clock. 

One of those clock genes, the *period* gene, is turned *on* during the night, resulting in the production and accumulation of PER protein. This accumulated PER protein then turns *off* the *period* gene, inhibiting its own production during the day. When, at the end of the day, the amount of PER protein has lowered sufficiently, the *period* gene is activated again. The fluctuation in PER protein (**Figure 2**) occurs with a rhythm of about 24 hours [2]. Fruit flies with a *period* gene cycle shorter than 24 hours showed a sleep-wake cycle that was also shorter than 24 hours. If the *period* gene was, on the other hand, completely turned off, fruit flies would lose all notion of time and fall asleep at random hours.

### The master clock and the peripheral clocks

It was initially thought that there was *one* biological clock that regulates *all* circadian rhythms. But when researchers removed the eyes from a frog and kept the eyes artificially alive, they discovered that, even without any connection to the brain, the frog's eyes were still producing the sleep-wake hormone melatonin with a 24 hour rhythm. Other researchers observed the same phenomenon in fruit flies in which the *period* gene was modified in such a way that light is emitted when the *period* gene is turned on. Surprisingly, when body parts were removed from the fruit flies, they would continue to glow and dim according to a 24 hour rhythm! 

We now know that nearly every cell, organ and tissue contains its own biological clocks, which are synchronized to our 24 hour day-night rhythm by the so-called *master clock* located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) in the brain (**Figure 3**). The SCN consists of about 20,000 nerve cells. That sounds like a lot, but the SCN is a remarkable tiny and highly efficient network of nerve cells that, through its central position, connects the eyes with the brain. In this way, light cues from the environment enable the master clock to coordinate the daily rhythms that, in turn, synchronize the *peripheral* clocks.

It has long remained unknown *how* the light cues were actually transmitted to the master clock. At the turn of the century, chronobiologists discovered a new type of light receptors in the human eye. These *retinal ganglion cells* are especially sensitive to blue light and enable direct communication from the eye to the master clock. 

### Zeitgebers

How can the internal circadian rhythm be adjusted to the period of another rhythm, our 24 hour day-night cycle? The process to make the internal clock fit the external day-night rhythm is called *entrainment* and occurs based on time cues or *zeitgebers*. Imagine the biological clock as a swing moving back and forth from morning to evening. The swing has its own internal rhythm of about a day. The *zeitgeber* can be seen as the person pushing the swing to adjust its rhythm to follow exactly 24 hours. The effect on the swing's rhythm will depend on *when* the swing is pushed: if pushed while moving away, the swing will speed up; if pushed while moving toward the *zeitgeber*, the swing will slow down (**Figure 4**).

### Entrainment

When thinking of light as the zeitgeber or pusher of the swing (**Figure 4**), light (or a push) in the morning will speed up the internal rhythm and compresses the length of the internal day, whereas light (or a push) in the evening slows down the internal rhythm and expands the length of the internal day. This synchronisation of the internal rhythm to our 24 hour day-night rhythm, however, has its consequences. 

For example, the internal clock in people with an internal rhythm longer than 24 hours needs to be compressed to be in sync with a 24 hour rhythm. To catch more of the compressing early morning light and less of the expanding evening light, their internal clocks will move to a *later* external time (**Figure 5B**). Consequently, people with a circadian rhythm *longer* than 24 hours, will tend to wake up and go to bed later, whereas people with a circadian rhythm *shorter* than 24 hours, will tend to wake up and go to bed earlier (**Figure 5C**).

<b>Figure 5:</b> (<b>A</b>) When the internal rhythm matches the 24 hour external day-night rhythm, the internal clock is synchronized to the external clock (or time of day). (<b>B</b>) When the internal rhythm is longer than 24 hours, the internal clock needs to be compressed. This is achieved by moving the internal clock to a <i>later</i> external time, exposing more of the compression portion to the light. These are the late <i>chronotypes</i>. (<b>C</b>) When the internal rhythm is shorter than 24 hours, the internal clock will need to be expanded, moving the internal clock to an <i>earlier</i> external time. These are the early <i>chronotypes</i>. Figure adapted from Internal time [4].

### The hand of the clock

The constant synchronization of the biological clock makes that we can adapt to new time zones, for example after an overseas trip or when changing to daylight savings time. The experiment in **Figure 1** already showed that the deregulated sleep-wake rhythm in test animals could be easily recovered after entraining to a 24-hour day-light rhythm. Daylight, and other *zeitgebers*, trigger the start of various *daily rhythms* in the master clock in the SCN. One of those daily rhythms is the release of the hormone melatonin, therefore named *the hand of the clock*. Melatonin induces sleepiness and plays a crucial role in our sleep-wake rhythm. Besides the sleep-wake rhythm, various other daily rhythms (**Figure 6**) are regulated by the master clock such as our body temperature or blood pressure. These daily rhythms on their turn play support the synchronization of the peripheral biological clocks.

### Social Jetlag

Our body is at its best when the peripheral clocks are aligned with the master clock. The most important *zeitgeber* to support the synchronization of the master clock is light. Besides light, also the times at which you eat, sleep or exercise can help synchronize the biological clock. But be aware: the same factors can also deregulate your biological clock! A disturbed sleep-wake rhythm, e.g., as a result of a night shift or jetlag, but also eating at irregular hours can deregulate the peripheral clocks and have a negative effect on your focus, appetite, feelings or performance. You may recognize this feeling, a so-called *social jetlag*, from a Monday morning when you have to wake up early for work after having slept in during the weekend. When the peripheral clocks are de-synchronized for too long, this can even lead to health issues. So for a healthy and vital life, you'd better keep your *social* and *biological* clocks aligned!
