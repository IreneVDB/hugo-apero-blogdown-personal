## Abstract

Wearable devices enable continuous, longitudinal collection of physiological or behavioral data. Initially geared towards consumer health enthusiasts, research- and clinical grade wearable devices now find their way into medical research and clinical trials. <p>
This talk will highlight **the potential of digital biomarkers** to advance personalized medicine as well as the central role for R in the **connection, integration, analysis, and/or visualization of health data** from digital devices. <p>
First, two digital biomarkers with promising clinical utility will be introduced: *continuous glucose monitoring* (CGM) and *heart rate variability* (HRV). The discussion will also include personal use experiences and reference to R packages specifically developed for CGM and HRV data analysis. <p>
The second part of the talk will showcase examples from a two-year long personal project (you R what you measure) to **quantify and visualize health and habits**. Use cases include the connection and visualization of data from popular wearable devices and smartphone apps for *sleep*, *activity* and *productivity* tracking, all using the R programming language.
