  Hi there! I'm Irene.

<!-- this is a subheadline -->
I am a **data visualization** and **quantified self** enthusiast with an interest in **digital health** and **precision medicine**. As a former professional cyclist with a PhD in biomarker research, I currently combine a part time job as a university teacher with a freelance business and passion project **‘You Are What You Measure’**. <p>
  Using apps, sensors and wearable devices, I collect and visualize data about my sleep, activity, nutrition, mood, body, brain, environment, and habits. Here, I'll share my insights from self-tracking as well as my continuous learning path to improve my data visualization and R programming skills!
