  I am a **data visualization** and **quantified self** enthusiast with an interest in **digital health** and **precision medicine**. As a former professional cyclist with a PhD in biomarker research, I currently combine a part time job as a university teacher with a freelance business and passion project **‘You R What You Measure’**. <p>

  Here, I'll share my insights from **self-tracking** as well as my **R** and **DataViz** tinkering! <p>
  
    - I give **presentations** and **workshops** about self-tracking, data visualization and/or the R programming language (see [Talks](/talk/) and [Blog](/blog/)). 
    - I create (interactive) **data visualizations** or **web applications** to support (sensor-based) studies and citizen science projects related to health, lifestyle or living environment (see [Projects](/project/)). <p> 
  
  I love to talk about my passions and share my insights with others!
