intro: |
  Using apps, sensors and wearable devices, I collect and visualize data about my sleep, activity,     nutrition, mood, body, brain, environment, and habits. <p>
  
  I love to talk about my passions and share my insights with others! As a freelancer, I give **presentations** and **workshops** about self-tracking, data visualization and/or the R programming language (see [Talks](talks) and [Blog](blog)). In addition, I create (interactive) **data visualizations** or **web applications** to support (sensor-based) studies and citizen science projects related to health, lifestyle or living environment (see [Projects](projects) and [DataViz](dataviz)). <p> 
  Please [contact me](contact) to get in touch or introduce yourself!
