intro: |
I am a **data visualization** and **quantified self** enthusiast with an interest in **digital health** and **precision medicine**. As a former professional cyclist with a PhD in biomarker research, I currently combine a part time job as a university teacher with a freelance business and passion project **‘You Are What You Measure’**. <p>

  Using apps, sensors and wearable devices, I collect and visualize data about my sleep, activity,     nutrition, mood, body, brain, environment, and habits.  Here, I'll share my insights from self-tracking as well as my continuous learning path to improve my data visualization and R programming skills! <p>
  
  I love to talk about my passions and share my insights with others! As a freelancer, I give **presentations** and **workshops** about self-tracking, data visualization and/or the R programming language (see [Talks](/talk/) and [Blog](/blog/)). In addition, I create (interactive) **data visualizations** or **web applications** to support (sensor-based) studies and citizen science projects related to health, lifestyle or living environment (see [Projects](/project/) and [DataViz](dataviz)). <p> 
  
  Please [contact me](/contact/) to get in touch or introduce yourself!
