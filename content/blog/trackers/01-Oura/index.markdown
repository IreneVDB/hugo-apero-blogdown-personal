## What is the ≈åura Ring?

A pretty piece of jewelry on the outside with a variety of sensors hidden on the inside\! The [≈åura Ring](https://oura.com) is a **Sleep** and **Activity** tracker that measures heart and breathing rate, skin temperature, and motion. Without any effort, and with very little non-wear time, I have already collected a wealth of data over **614** days. Here, you can read all about my experiences collecting, analyzing and visualizing my ≈åura Ring data\!

## How to get your data?

All daily activity and nightly sleep data are stored on your (free) ≈åura cloud account. Both the ≈åura cloud platform and the ≈åura app have some nice features to view daily, weekly or monthly trends in your data. However, if you (like me üòÑ) want to analyze and visualize your own data, you can get the data in your own hands by either:

1.  Export your data as a`.csv` or `.json` file from the Oura cloud account; or
2.  Connect through ≈åura cloud API using a *personal access token*.

The available data from the ≈åura Ring is summarized below. A detailed description of all measured parameters can also be found in the ≈åura Ring [API documentation](https://cloud.ouraring.com/docs/).

## Data for Sleep and Activity Tracking

In the below panels you see an overview of all numeric data values measured with the ≈åura Ring during sleep (Fig. <a href="#fig:SleepMetrics">1</a>) or daily activity (Fig. <a href="#fig:ActivityMetrics">2</a>).

## Sleep, Activity and Readiness Scores

Based on the Sleep and Activity metrics, the ≈åura Ring calculates a daily **Sleep**, **Activity** and **Readiness** score. In Figure <a href="#fig:TotalScores">3</a>, you see the distribution of my scores over 614 days, whereas the panels underneath show the distribution in the individual scores used to calculate the total scores.

### Daily Time Series

## Conclusion

The ≈åura Ring stands out for it‚Äôs **data accessibility** and the **ease of wearing**.

Although the ≈åura Ring isn‚Äôt cheap, it‚Äôs fashionable look and compact size, make the ≈åura Ring easily worn day and night, collecting a wealth a data with little to no missing data points\! The ≈åura ring fully charges in about 1-2 hours and lasts for almost 4 days. As a sleep tracker, the ≈åura Ring is great for tracking your sleep pattern and nightly body functions. However, the ≈åura Ring is not very accurate in sleep staging, particularly in differentiating laying down from actual sleeping.

### ≈åura Ring - Pros:

  - Good data visualization options in app and cloud platform.
  - Data is fully accessible through file export or API.
  - No bluetooth connection during inactivity or sleep.
  - Can be worn day and night without noticing.
  - Little ‚Äúnon-wear‚Äù time due to charging.
  - Fashionable look.

### ≈åura Ring - Cons:

  - Not cheap (price starts at $299).
  - Not very accurate in sleep stage detection (certainly not able to differentiate laying still from actual sleeping).
  - Be careful; you don‚Äôt want to lose or damage the ring\!
  - Skin temperature and breathing rate data are only available as a nightly average.
  - Meditation data is not available.
