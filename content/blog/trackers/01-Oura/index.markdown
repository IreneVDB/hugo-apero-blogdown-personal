## What is the ÅŒura Ring?

A pretty piece of jewelry on the outside with a variety of sensors hidden on the inside! The [ÅŒura Ring](https://oura.com) is both a **Sleep** and **Activity** tracker that measures heart and breathing rate, skin temperature, and motion to calculate your daily **Sleep**, **Activity** and **Readiness** scores. <p>

The ÅŒura Ring app integrates with the Apple or Samsung Health app as well as various third party workout apps. You can also start a guided or unguided **mediation** session in the ÅŒura Ring app while the ÅŒura Ring records your heart rate, heart rate variability (HRV) and skin temperature. 

## How to get the ÅŒura Ring's data?

All daily activity and nightly sleep data are stored on your (free) ÅŒura cloud account. Both the ÅŒura cloud platform and the ÅŒura app have some nice features to view daily, weekly or monthly trends in your data. However, if you (like me ðŸ˜„) want to analyze and visualize your own data, there are several ways to get the data in your own hands:

  1. Export your data as a`.csv ` or `.json` file from the Oura cloud account; or
  2. Connect through ÅŒura cloud API using a *personal access token*.

Note that only aggregated data is accessible, either as a single value or, for a few metrics, as average over 1 or 5 minute intervals.

## What does the Oura Ring measure?

The ÅŒura Ring [API documentation](https://cloud.ouraring.com/docs/) provides a detailed description of all measured parameters. The data from the ÅŒura Ring includes:
- Daily Sleep, Activity and Readiness Scores.
- Daily (or nightly) aggregates (e.g., total sleep hours, step counts, or average breathing rate while asleep)
- Daily time stamps (e.g., the time you go to bed, fall asleep or get up)
- Daily or nightly time series (as average per 1 or 5 minute intervals)

### Daily Sleep, Activity or Readiness Scores

Every day the ÅŒura Ring gives a score for your Sleep, Activity and Readiness. In Figure \@ref(fig:TotalScores_dim), you see the distribution of my scores over 610 days of measurement.

Each score is calculated based on the following scores summarized in the panels below:

## ÅŒura Ring: Pros and Cons

The ÅŒura Ring stands out for it's **data accessibility** and the **ease of wearing**. 

Although the ÅŒura Ring isn't cheap, it's fashionable look and compact size, make the ÅŒura Ring easily worn day and night, collecting a wealth a data with little to no missing data points! The ÅŒura ring fully charges in about 1-2 hours and lasts for almost 4 days. As a sleep tracker, the ÅŒura Ring is great for tracking your sleep pattern and nightly body functions. However, the ÅŒura Ring is not very accurate in sleep staging, particularly in differentiating laying down from actual sleeping. 

### ÅŒura Ring - Pros:

- Good data visualization options in app and cloud platform.
- Data is fully accessible through file export or API.
- No bluetooth connection during inactivity or sleep.
- Can be worn day and night without noticing.
- Little "non-wear" time due to charging.
- Fashionable look.

### ÅŒura Ring - Cons:

- Not cheap (price starts at $299).
- Not very accurate in sleep stage detection (certainly not able to differentiate laying still from actual sleeping).
- Be careful; you don't want to lose or damage the ring!
- Skin temperature and breathing rate data are only available as a nightly average.
- Meditation data is not available.
