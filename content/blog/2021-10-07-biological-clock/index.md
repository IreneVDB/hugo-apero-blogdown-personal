### What is a biological clock?

A biological clock is an internal timing mechanism that regulates the rhythmic occurrence of certain processes within plants, animals and humans. The sleep-wake cycle, the female menstrual cycle, bird migration or the mating behavior of animals are all examples of daily, monthly, annual or seasonal rhythms. A *circadian rhythm*, from the Latin *circa* and *dies* (meaning *about* and *day*), is a rhythm that occurs a little shorter or longer than the 24 hours of a day. A crucial feature of a biological clock and the circadian rhythm is that the rhythm continues even when there is no (external) notion of time. 

### The first discoveries

The difference between *internal* and *external* regulation was first described by Jean Jacques dâ€™Ortous de Mairan. In the 18th century, the French mathematician and astronomer was intrigued by the opening and folding of the leaves of his mimosa plants with the rising and setting of the sun. When he placed the plants in a dark closet, he discovered that the plants, even in the absence of sun light, kept opening and folding with the same daily rhythm.

A similar external regulation was demonstrated in animals that were kept in either a lit or darkened room. While their activity patterns showed a very constant rhythm, the time at which the animals were active moved to an earlier or later time every day (**Figure 1**). This circadian rhythm has also been demonstrated in man [1]. In 1962, the French geologist Michel Siffre stayed in an underground cave without any sunlight, trying to record the time of day. Even though Siffre thought he had spend 37 nights underground instead of the 62 nights that had actually passed, the times at which he had dinner, went to bed and woke up showed that his biological clock kept working with a regular rhythm of about 24 hours.

When placed in a room without light, their activity pattern remains rhythmic over a period that is longer 24 hours.  When, on the other hand, placed in a constantly lit environment, they will be active a little earlier every day. For nocturnal animals the pattern is reversed: their sleep-wake rhythm will be shorter when placed in a dark environment. Figure adapted from Circadian Rhytms in Man [1].

### Chronobiology: the study of circadian rhythms

Although the existence of a biological clock was known for a while, the exact working has only been revealed over the past decades. In 2017, the Nobel prize for physiology or medicine was awarded to three chronobiologists for their work on circadian rhythms. The researchers have discovered the so-called *clock genes* (with names as *period*, *timeless*, and *doubletime*) that are involved in the regulation of the biological clock. 

One of those clock genes, the *period* gene, is turned *on* during the night, resulting in the production and accumulation of PER protein. This accumulated PER protein then turns off the *period* gene, inhibiting its own production during the day. When, at the end of the day, the amount of PER protein has lowered sufficiently, the *period* gene is activated again. The fluctuation in PER protein (**Figure 2**) occurs with a rhythm of about 24 hours [2]. Fruit flies with a *period* gene cycle shorter than 24 hours showed a sleep-wake cycle that was also shorter than 24 hours. If the *period* gene was, on the other hand, completely turned off, fruit flies would lose all notion of time and fall asleep at random hours.

### The master clock and the periferal clocks

When researchers removed the eyes from a frog and kept the eyes artificially alive, they discovered that the frog's eyes were still producing the sleep-wake hormone melatonin following a circadian rhythm, even without any connection to the brain! Other researchers discovered that if body parts were removed from fruit flies in which the *period* gene was modified in such a way that light is emitted when the *period* gene is turned on, the removed body parts would continue to glow and dim according to a 24 hour rhythm. We now know that there is not one internal clock that regulates *all* circadian rhythms, but that nearly every cell, organ and tissue contains its own biological clocks.

All these individual, *periferal* clocks are synchronized to our 24 hour day-night rhythm by the so-called *master clock* located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) in the brain (**Figure 3**). The SCN consists of about 20,000 nerve cells. That sounds like a lot, but the SCN is a remarkable tiny and highly efficient network of nerve cells that, through its central position, connects the eyes with the brain. In this way, light cues from the environment enable the master clock to coordinate the daily rhythms that, in turn, synchronize the *periferal* clocks.

It has long remained unknown *how* the light cues were actually transmitted to the master clock. At the turn of the century chronobiologists discovered a new type of light receptors in the human eye. These *retinal ganglion cells* are especially sensitive to blue light and enable direct communication from the eye to the master clock. 

### Zeitgebers

How can the internal circadian rhythm be adjusted to the period of another rhythm, our 24 hour day-night cycle? The process to make the internal clock fit the external day-night rhythmis called *entrainment* and occurs based on time cues or  *zeitgebers*.  Imagine the biological clock as a swing moving back and forth from morning to evening. The swing has its own internal rhythm of about a day. The zeitgeber can be seen as the person pushing the swing to adjust its rhythm to follow exactly 24 hours. The effect on the swing's rhythm will depend on *when* the swing is pushed: if pushed while moving away, the swing will speed up; if pushed while moving toward the *zeitgeber*, the swing will slow down (**Figure 4**).

<figcaption>
<b>Figure 4:</b> The swing represents the biological clock with a circadian rhythm. The <i>zeitgeber</i> pushes the swing to adjust its rhythm to the 24 hour day-night cycle [3].
</figcaption>

When thinking of light as the zeitgeber or pusher of the swing (**Figure 4**), light (or a push) in the morning will speed up the internal rhythm and compresses the length of the internal day, whereas light (or a push) in the evening slows down the internal rhythm and expands the length of the internal day.

<figcaption>
<b>Figure 5:</b> (**A**) When the internal rhythm matches the 24 hour external day-night rhythm, the internal clock is synchronized to the external clock (or time of day). (**B**) When the internal rhythm is longer than 24 hours, the internal clock needs to be compressed. This is achieved by moving the internal clock to a lter external time

exposing more of the compression portion to the light {MOVE TO RIGHT}

Figuur 5:  Als het inwendige ritme gelijk is aan 24 uur, zal de inwendige klok synchroon lopen aan de uitwendige klok, de tijd van de dag (A). Als het inwendige ritme langer is dan 24 uur (B) dan wordt de inwendige klok vertraagd waardoor deze iets achter komt te lopen op de tijd van de dag. Als het inwendige ritme korter is dan 24 uur zal de inwendige klok versneld moeten worden waardoor de inwendige klok voor loopt op de tijd van de dag (C). De mate van vertraging of versnelling hangt af van het moment en de kracht van de zeitgeber. Licht in de ochtend versnelt de inwendige klok. Hoe sterker het licht, hoe meer de klok versnelt kan worden. Naar een voorbeeld uit Internal time [4].

The constant synchronisation of the internal rhythm to the external, 24 hour rhythm, however, has its consequences. When the rhythm of the *internal* clcok is shorter than 24 hour, it has to be expanded, whereas an internal clock with a rhythm longer than 24 hour needs to be compressed. Light kan prolng and sjorten the internal rhythm depended on the time of day at wghich the inetrenal clock ios 'pushed' by the zeitgever (**Figure 4**).
 Peiple with an internal rhythm *longer* than 24 hour will therefoe achterlopen on the 240hour light-dark cycle so daylight can have more ffect on the internal rrhythm at those timeswhen it is sensitive to be shortend. This is most proniunced for so-called night owls or adolescents that are late chronotupes. Th eotherway around morning people or ealry chrontypes have an interanl clock that walks ahead of the external day-night rhythm. Therwith daylight can release its effects when the ecternal clcok is esensitive to be prolonged (**Figure 5*).


 

### Chronotypes

The most important zeitgeber is light. Besides light, also the times at which you eat, sleep or exercise can help the biological synchronize. But be aware: the same factors can also deregulate your biological clock!






### Melatonin: the hand of the clock

The constant synchronisation of the biological clock makes that we can adapt to new time zones, for xample afer an overseas trip or when chaging to daylight savings time. THe experiment in **Figure 1** shows that de deregulated sleep-wake prhythm in test animals could be reocvered after synchronizing with a 24-hour day-light rhythm. Daylight, and other zeitgebers, trigger the start of variosy *daily rhythms* in the master clock in the SCN. One of those daily rhythms is the relase of the hormone melatonin, which is therefore also named 'the hand of the clock'. Melatonin induces sleepiness and plays a crucial role in our sleep-wkae rhythm. Besides the sleep-wake rhythm variosu other daily rhythms (**Figure 6**) regulated by the master clock, like the rgeulation of body teneprature or blood pressure. These daily rhythms on their turn play a role in regulating the perfieral biologiacl clcocks.

### Social Jetlag

The body works at its best when the periferal clcpkcs are aligned with the master clock. A disturbed sleep-wake rhythm, for example as a result of night shift or a hetlag, but also eating ath irregular hours can deregulate the periferal clocks and have a negative effect on your focus, appetite, feelings or performance, You may recognize this effect from a monday morning when you have to recatch the early wake up after haveing slept in in the weekes. You can compare this dfeeling with a jhetlag, but it its a *social jetlag* where the social clock is disrupting the biological clcok. WHen the perfireal clocks are desynchronized for a long time, this cna even result in health issues For a healthy and vutal life it it therefore important to keep the biological and periferal clcok aligned with one another!
